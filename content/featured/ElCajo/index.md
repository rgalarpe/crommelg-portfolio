A React project created to demonstrate the level of understanding in BrowserRouter, Router, Switch, Router in react-router-dom. Created css from searching and copying examples on stackoverflow, youtube tutorials and other forums. Created and deployed with some drawbacks on its responsiveness.

Conclusion Use Web Components UI library like materialui and materialize if the UI doesn't require a specific Design.
