Hello! I am Rommel—my friends call me Mel. from the City of Golden Friendship—Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines.

I am a straightforward and dependable developer who values clean execution and continuous growth. I enjoy figuring things out, fixing what’s broken, solving issues, and learning better ways to get things done

I graduated in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Major in Database Systems in Mindanao State University at Naawan on the year 2018.

Before joining a global IT services firm, I wore many hats—from being a graphic designer, photographer and front-end web developer to a hands-on computer technician. These early experiences shaped my curiosity and passion for tech, giving me a well-rounded foundation beyond code. I also enjoy connecting with fellow developers and have been actively involved in our local Google Developer Group community.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
